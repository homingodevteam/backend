# Module Status Report

**Date:** 2026-08-10
**Branch:** `homingo-backend-m1`
**Scope:** every module in [`Modules_and_Features 1.md`](Modules_and_Features%201.md), with modules 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 audited feature-by-feature, gaps closed where they didn't depend on an unbuilt module, and verified by unit tests, e2e tests, a live boot and a full cURL pass.

**Companion documents:**

- [`CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md`](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md) — every contradiction between the source documents and how it was settled. Read it before disputing anything below.
- [`ERD_DATA_MODEL_V10.md`](ERD_DATA_MODEL_V10.md) — reference copy of the authoritative Eraser diagram.
- [`reports/FULL_API_CURL_REPORT_2026-08-10.md`](reports/FULL_API_CURL_REPORT_2026-08-10.md) — **116/116** across all six built modules, and the one defect it found.

**Supersedes** the 2026-08-07 edition. The 2026-08-08 verification pass and the 2026-08-10 module 3 and 4 builds are folded in.

| 14  | Config & Server-Driven UI | PlatformSetting, UiConfig                       | 🟡 **Partial** — `PlatformSetting` model exists; no API, no UiConfig |
| 15  | Admin Console & Reporting | AdminJob _(audit storage deferred)_             | ⬜ Not started; `AdminAuditLog` explicitly deferred                  |

"Stubbed" means the model exists in `prisma/schema.prisma` because a built module needed it as a foreign key or counter source — not that the module is partly built.

| 4   | Landmark and free-text delivery notes per address     | ⛔ **Out of scope, not a gap** — the ERD's `CustomerAddress` has `landmark` only. See ERD cross-check                                                                         |

## 3 · Service Catalog — 7/8 built, 1 half-cancelled by a ground rule

Built 2026-08-10. `ServiceCategory` and `Service` now exist, field-for-field per ERD v10, and the module owns `City` alongside them.

| #   | Feature                                                  | Status                                                                                                                                                            |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Category tree with nesting, display order, icons         | ✅ `ServiceCategory` with `parentCategoryId`, `sortOrder`, `iconUrl`. **Two levels, enforced** — see [conflict #10](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md)                   |
| 2   | Service definitions: name, description, duration, price  | ✅ `durationMinutes` + `flatPrice` `Decimal(12,2)`, one flat national price                                                                                       |
| 3   | Booking-type flags — instant, scheduled, recurring       | ✅ `supportsInstant` / `supportsScheduled` / `supportsRecurring`; an active service must keep at least one on                                                     |
| 4   | Active/inactive at category and service level            | ✅ Both. Services are created as **drafts** and activation is gated (US-3.11)                                                                                     |
| 5   | City registry with timezone; per-city activation         | ✅ Admin CRUD added — `POST/PATCH /admin/catalog/cities` + an activation route. Cities are created dark                                                           |
| 6   | Browse and search endpoints                              | ✅ Tree, category drill-down, filter/search, and by-id resolution                                                                                                 |
| 7   | Duration → Dispatch slot sizing **and Commission tiers** | ✅ / ⛔ — `getDurationMinutes()` is ready for module 5. The commission half is **cancelled** by the ground-rules table, [conflict #7](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md) |
| 8   | Catalog feeds the Server-Driven UI home config           | ⏸ Needs module 14 — `UiConfig` does not exist. Category `slug` is the intended join key and is immutable after creation                                           |

**The two dangling foreign keys are closed.** `ProService.serviceId` and `Booking.serviceId` were bare `String` columns with no FK and no `@db.Uuid`, and nothing validated them — `ProServiceAssignmentsService.assign()` accepted any string, producing Pros competent at services that did not exist. Both are now `@db.Uuid` with `ON DELETE RESTRICT` foreign keys, and the assignment path resolves the id through the catalog first. This was the largest correctness gap in the shipped code.

### API surface

| Public (no auth — the catalogue is what a first-time user sees) |                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /cities`                                                   | Unchanged, still live                       |
| `GET /catalog/categories`                                       | Active tree, two levels, with services      |
| `GET /catalog/categories/:id/services`                          | Category drill-down                         |
| `GET /catalog/services`                                         | Filter by `categoryId`, `q`, `bookingType`  |
| `GET /catalog/services/:id`                                     | **Resolves inactive services too** — US-3.1 |

| Admin                                                                                   | Permission               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `GET/POST /admin/catalog/categories`, `PATCH :id`, `PATCH :id/activation`, `DELETE :id` | `catalog.manage`         |
| `GET/POST /admin/catalog/services`, `PATCH :id`, `PATCH :id/activation`                 | `catalog.manage`         |
| `PATCH /admin/catalog/services/:id/commission`                                          | `catalog.commission.set` |
| `GET/POST /admin/catalog/cities`, `PATCH :id`, `PATCH :id/activation`                   | `catalog.city.manage`    |

Commission is a separate route behind a separate permission so repricing and changing what a Pro earns stay distinct operations (US-3.10, US-8.4). Seeded: `ops` gets `catalog.manage` + `catalog.city.manage`; `finance` gets `catalog.commission.set`.

**Not city-scoped, deliberately.** The catalogue is national by ground rule, so `CityScopeGuard` has nothing to scope on — an Indore ops user editing a price does affect Mumbai. That follows from the pricing model ([conflict #8](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md)), and is a product risk worth knowing rather than a bug.

### Rules enforced, each with a test

| Rule                                                                   | Story          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Cannot activate a service with no commission rate → `409`              | US-3.11        |
| `percent` rate capped at 100; `flat` may exceed it (rupees)            | US-3.10        |
| Cannot activate a service under an inactive category → `409`           | US-3.8         |
| Deactivation is unconditional and never cancels sold work              | US-3.7         |
| Cannot delete a category holding children or services → `409`          | US-3.8         |
| Category depth bounded at two levels; no self-parent, no cycles        | —              |
| An active service must keep ≥1 booking type                            | F#3            |
| Price/duration edits touch nothing else — no commission, no `isActive` | US-3.5, US-3.6 |
| Category `slug` unique and immutable after creation                    | —              |

The database carries the same guarantees independently: `CHECK` constraints for the commission range, the active-requires-commission rule and the active-requires-booking-type rule, plus `ON DELETE RESTRICT` behind the orphaning rules.

### User-story audit

Every US-3.x story in [`user-stories-by-persona/`](user-stories-by-persona/), checked against the shipped code rather than against the feature list.

| Story                                                  | Persona | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **US-3.1** Browse categories and services              | C       | ✅ Tree, drill-down and search. Edge — inactive services vanish from browse but stay resolvable by id — implemented and tested                                                                                        |
| **US-3.2** See one flat price                          | C       | ✅ for the catalog's part: `flatPrice` on browse, and the platform/Pro split is absent from `ServiceDto` (asserted in the Swagger test). The "same number on booking summary, invoice and history" half is module 4's |
| **US-3.3** Home screen without an app update           | C/A     | ⏸ Module 14. `UiConfig` does not exist; category `slug` is the intended join key and is immutable                                                                                                                     |
| **US-3.4** Create a service                            | A       | ✅ **with a deviation** — commission is a second call, see [conflict #17](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md). Edge (one flat national price) holds                                                                           |
| **US-3.5** Change a service price                      | A       | 🟡 Price edit works and provably touches nothing else. **"Audited" is not satisfied** — no attribution exists ([#9](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md), [#14](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md))                                   |
| **US-3.6** Change a service duration                   | A       | ✅ Edit works; nothing cascades. "Does not resize bookings already placed" is guaranteed by module 4 snapshotting, which is not built                                                                                 |
| **US-3.7** Deactivate a service with live bookings     | A       | ✅ Deactivation is unconditional and cascades nowhere, tested. Fully demonstrable only once bookings exist                                                                                                            |
| **US-3.8** Restructure the category tree               | A       | ✅ Reparent, activate, delete. Orphaning blocked twice over — a `409` with a readable message, and `ON DELETE RESTRICT` beneath it                                                                                    |
| **US-3.9** Activate a new city                         | A       | ✅ **Gap found in this audit and closed** — see below                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **US-3.10** Set a commission rate                      | A/P     | ✅ Own endpoint, own permission, range-validated. "Future completions only" is inherent: nothing rewrites history                                                                                                     |
| **US-3.11** Activate a service with no commission rate | A/S     | ✅ Blocked in the service layer **and** by a `CHECK` constraint                                                                                                                                                       |
| **US-8.4** Reprice without touching commission         | A/P     | ✅ Separate routes; a test asserts a price update never writes the commission columns. The "ops must see which mode" half is a UI requirement                                                                         |
| **US-8.8** Discover a service with no commission rate  | S/A     | ✅ Made unreachable by US-3.11's two layers, which is what the story asks for                                                                                                                                         |

**US-3.9's edge case was missing.** The story reads: _"Activating a city with no approved Pros in it produces bookings nobody can serve. **Gate on supply.**"_ Nothing checked. Launching a city now returns `409 CITY_HAS_NO_SUPPLY` when no approved Pro is based there, overridable with `acknowledgeNoSupply: true` — a gate, not a prohibition, since opening a city ahead of the first approved cohort is legitimate. Pausing a city is never gated.

That check needs Pro counts inside a Catalog operation, while Pro Management needs the catalogue to validate service assignments — a genuinely bidirectional dependency, wired with `forwardRef` on both sides. [`test/module-graph.e2e-spec.ts`](../test/module-graph.e2e-spec.ts) compiles the real `AppModule` and asserts both injections resolve, because a `forwardRef` mistake is invisible to unit tests and surfaces only at boot.

### Known gaps in this module

- **No audit of catalog edits at all.** Not even "who last touched this row" — ERD v10 gives the catalog tables no editor column, and `AdminAuditLog` is deferred. See [conflicts #9 and #14](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md). This is the sharpest open gap here.
- **No per-service cash flag.** The Cash ground rule names `Service.allowsCash`; the ERD has no such column, so it was not added ([conflict #13](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md)).
- **Search is a sequential scan**, deliberately — a few hundred national rows do not justify `pg_trgm`, which needs a `CREATE EXTENSION` privilege the RDS app role may not have.

📋 [`MODULE_3_SERVICE_CATALOG_PLAN.md`](MODULE_3_SERVICE_CATALOG_PLAN.md) is the plan this was built from. **Its §3 schema is superseded** by the ERD reconciliation — see [conflict #15](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md) for the seven field names that changed.

## 4 · Booking & Job Lifecycle — 19/22 built

Built 2026-08-10. The largest module in the system: 5 tables, 29 endpoints, and the state machine every other module reads from.

**A cash job runs end to end today** — create → assign → en route → arrived → start OTP → completed → invoice. Online bookings stop at `awaiting_payment` behind a port, because Payments (module 7) does not exist. That line comes from the Cash ground rule, not from cutting scope: a cash booking has no `Order` row and skips `awaiting_payment` by design.

_Creation (6/7)_

| #   | Feature                                   | Status                                                                                                                         |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Instant booking, dispatch immediately     | ✅ Created and handed to the dispatch port. **Assignment itself is manual** until module 5 — `POST /admin/bookings/:id/assign` |
| 2   | Scheduled booking from real availability  | 🟡 Slots are accepted, validated as future-dated and stored; they are **not** checked against real Pro availability            |
| 3   | Recurring plans, auto-generating bookings | ✅ daily/weekly/biweekly/monthly, with a generator that is deliberately tolerant of one plan failing                           |
| 4   | Slot availability query                   | ⏸ Module 5 — `DispatchPort.getAvailableSlots()` returns `[]` rather than inventing slots nobody can work                       |
| 5   | Flat price quoted and frozen              | ✅ Read from the catalogue at creation, never recomputed. Closes [conflict #11](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md)                    |
| 6   | One-tap rebook                            | ✅ Copies service and address, records lineage, **never pins the Pro** — rotation wins                                         |
| 7   | Human-readable booking number             | ✅ `HB-2026-000123` from a Postgres sequence, mirroring `employeeCode`                                                         |
| —   | _(US-4.6)_ Abandoned checkouts expire     | ✅ `POST /admin/bookings/expire-unpaid` sweeps `awaiting_payment` past the hold window. Window A, so nothing is refunded       |

_Lifecycle (3/3)_

| #   | Feature                         | Status                                                                                                                         |
| --- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 8   | State machine with cancellation | ✅ As a transition table, not an ordered list — payment mode forks it ([#20](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md)). All 81 pairs tested |
| 9   | Append-only status event log    | ✅ Actor, timestamp **and coordinates**, written in the same transaction as the status change                                  |
| 10  | Repeat transitions preserved    | ✅ `en_route ⇄ arrived` repeats freely; `arrivedAt` holds the authoritative first arrival                                      |

_Service-start OTP (4/4)_

| #   | Feature                              | Status                                                                                                          |
| --- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11  | OTP issued on arrival                | ✅ Sent to the **customer's** phone, reusing module 1's `SlideOtpProvider` — no new integration                 |
| 12  | Pro enters it; third-party verify    | ✅ Verification is the provider's answer, never the app's claim                                                 |
| 13  | Only a verified OTP sets `startedAt` | ✅ Enforced in code **and** by a `CHECK` constraint. The one documented exception is an audited ops force-start |
| 14  | Attempt counting + provider ref      | ✅ A wrong code counts an attempt and deliberately does **not** pause the grace clock                           |

_Execution (3/5)_

| #   | Feature                             | Status                                                                                                                                    |
| --- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 15  | Live tracking (position + ETA)      | 🟡 `GET /bookings/:id/tracking` reads the Pro GEO index, falls back to the cold flush, and reports `isStale`. **ETA is null** — module 13 |
| 16  | In-app chat scoped to the booking   | ✅ No contact detail in any chat DTO, asserted in the Swagger test. Writes close 24h after completion; reads never                        |
| 17  | Mandatory geo-stamped photo proof   | ✅ Completion is **refused** without at least one completion photo. Keys namespaced per booking                                           |
| 18  | Actual duration from verified start | ✅ Computed and stored — **reporting only**. The "commission is calculated from" clause is [cancelled](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md)        |
| 19  | Route trail at completion           | ⏸ Module 13 — nothing accumulates a GPS trail today. Column exists, deliberately left null                                                |

_Close-out (2/3)_

| #   | Feature                        | Status                                                                                              |
| --- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20  | Cancellation with reason/actor | ✅ All six windows. Fee and refund resolved from the window; window E routes to a human             |
| 21  | Invoice on the booking         | 🟡 Number, tax and `invoicedAt` generated at completion. **PDF deferred** — nothing renders one yet |
| 22  | Booking history and live views | ✅ Customer history + live orders, Pro job list, and the one-call admin reconstruction              |

### The state machine

```
                 ┌─ cash ──────────────────────────┐
created ─────────┤                                 ├──> assigning ──> assigned
                 └─ online ──> awaiting_payment ───┘                     │
                                                                         v
completed <── started <── arrived <──> en_route <────────────────────────┘
```

`cancelled` is reachable from every live state and from none of the terminal ones. `completed` is terminal — a finished job is disputed, never cancelled.

### Rules enforced, each with a test

| Rule                                                                        | Source           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Price frozen at creation; never recomputed                                  | US-3.2, US-3.5   |
| `paymentMode` frozen; cash and online take different paths out of `created` | Cash ground rule |
| Only a provider-verified OTP or an audited ops force-start sets `startedAt` | US-4.12          |
| A failed OTP counts an attempt and does not pause the grace clock           | US-4.13          |
| Completion refused without a verified start                                 | F#13             |
| Completion refused without ≥1 completion photo                              | US-4.16          |
| A Pro has no cancellation route at any depth                                | Principle 2      |
| Cancelling after `started` is ops-only                                      | US-4.21          |
| No fee when the platform is the party that failed                           | US-4.22          |
| Photo keys namespaced per booking; foreign keys rejected                    | —                |
| Booking creation idempotent per `Idempotency-Key`                           | Cross-cutting    |
| Chat writes close after completion; reads never                             | US-4.8           |

The database carries its own guarantees independently: `CHECK` constraints bound every enum-ish column, and refuse a `started` booking with no `startedAt`, a `completed` one with no `completedAt`, or a `cancelled` one with no `cancelledAt`. `cancelledByType` is constrained to `customer | ops | system` — a Pro cannot be recorded as a canceller even by a future code path.

### The two ports

Module 4 owns interfaces for the two modules it needs that do not exist, so every code path around them is written and tested now:

| Port           | For      | No-op behaviour                                                                        |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DispatchPort` | Module 5 | Leaves the booking in `assigning`; returns **no** slots rather than inventing them     |
| `PaymentsPort` | Module 7 | `createOrder` fails loudly with `501`; a fake order id would strand a booking silently |

Swapping in the real modules is two `provide` lines in `bookings.module.ts` and nothing else.

### User-story audit

All 24 US-4.x stories across the three personas, checked against the shipped code rather than the feature list.

| Story                                           | Persona | Status                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **US-4.1** Book an instant service              | C       | ✅ Edge honoured in reverse — a cash booking dispatches before money moves, so "charging then failing to assign" cannot happen. For online, nothing is charged until Payments exists |
| **US-4.2** Pick a scheduled slot                | C       | 🟡 Slot accepted, future-dated and stored; **not validated against real availability**. Over-selling is unguarded — module 5                                                         |
| **US-4.3** Recurring cleaning                   | C       | ✅ Including the edge that matters most: a failed occurrence **never deactivates the plan**, only the plan's own end date does                                                       |
| **US-4.5** Rebook a past service                | C       | ✅ Lineage recorded, Pro never pinned ([#22](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md))                                                                                                            |
| **US-4.6** Abandon checkout                     | C/S     | ✅ **Gap found in this audit and closed** — the hold-window sweep had no caller. Pay-after-expiry is module 7's webhook                                                              |
| **US-4.7** Watch the Pro approach               | C       | ✅ **Gap found in this audit and closed** — the endpoint was planned but never built. `isStale` implemented; ETA is module 13                                                        |
| **US-4.8** Message the Pro                      | C/P     | ✅ No contact detail in the schema, asserted in the Swagger test. Chat closes ([#23](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md))                                                                    |
| **US-4.9** Mark en route                        | P       | ✅ Repeatable; every leg survives in the log                                                                                                                                         |

**Two gaps were found by this audit and closed.** `GET /bookings/:id/tracking` was in the plan's §4.1 and never built, and `cancelAsSystem` existed with no caller — the payment-hold setting was seeded but nothing read it. Both now ship with Swagger coverage.

### Known gaps in this module

- **No automatic assignment.** Ops assigns by hand. This is module 5's job and the route survives as the US-5.14 override once it exists.
- **Scheduled slots are unvalidated.** A customer can pick a time nobody is free for; dispatch resolves supply afterwards, which is what US-4.2 describes, but there is no over-selling guard.
- **No push notifications on any transition** (module 12), so a Pro is not yet told a job was cancelled under them — US-4.20's edge, and the one gap with a real-world cost today.
- **No `no_start` ticket** (module 11). The grace window is configured but nothing watches it.
- **No invoice PDF.**

## 5 · Dispatch Engine — 14/16 built

Built 2026-08-10. **Bookings now assign themselves.** Module 4's `DispatchPort` was already defined and stubbed, so the integration was registering one adapter — module 4 is unchanged.

| --- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Redis-queued intake, one job per booking     | ✅ A real Redis list. Drained by an admin route — there is still no job runner ([#30](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md))                    |
| 2   | Distributed lock per booking (`SET NX PX`)   | ✅ Released in a `finally`, so a thrown attempt cannot wedge a booking                                                                |
| 3   | Rule 1 — availability                        | ✅ Active `ProService` + `approved` + `isAvailable` + a free window. All three gates admin-set                                        |
| 4   | Free windows from committed bookings alone   | ✅ No roster involved; cached in Redis per Pro per day                                                                                |
| 5   | Travel origin resolution                     | ✅ Next job's address → live GPS → home base, and **which one was used is recorded** so US-5.7 stays answerable                       |
| 6   | Rule 2 — proximity                           | 🟡 Ranks correctly on straight-line time. Real road time is module 13 ([#29](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md))                             |
| 7   | Rule 3 — rotation                            | ✅ Indexed over `Booking(addressId, proId, completedAt)`, cooldown from `PlatformSetting`. A **penalty, not an exclusion**            |
| 8   | Rule 4 — tie-break                           | ✅ Duration fit → smoothed rating → fewest offers today → lowest `Pro.id`. Deterministic to the last step                             |
| 9   | Smoothed rating / cold start                 | ✅ `(ratingSum + priorMean × priorWeight) / (ratingCount + priorWeight)`. **`acceptanceRate` is not an input**, and a test asserts it |
| 10  | Every candidate persisted with score inputs  | ✅ 11 new columns. Excluded Pros get a row with a null `rank`, so "never a candidate" ≠ "ranked and lost"                             |
| 11  | Assignment written to booking; counters move | ✅ `assignmentsOffered` increments — **it never did before**, see below                                                               |
| 12  | Acknowledgement window                       | ✅ Receipt, not agreement. Idempotent                                                                                                 |
| 13  | No-ack retry with `already_tried` exclusion  | ✅ Their acceptance rate moves; their ranking does not                                                                                |
| 14  | Ops manual override                          | ✅ Built in module 4 (`POST /admin/bookings/:id/assign`), reason mandatory                                                            |
| 15  | ETA computation, published continuously      | ⏸ Modules 12 + 13. Straight-line time is good enough to rank, **not to quote**                                                        |
| 16  | Unassignable bookings surfaced to ops        | ✅ `no_supply` and `exhausted` kept distinct ([#31](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md))                                                      |

### A fourth counter bug, and the pattern behind all of them

Wiring a real caller to `ProCountersService` exposed a **third and fourth** instance of one pattern: three of its four methods were written before modules 4 and 5 existed, so each owned the _transition_ as well as the counter. Each broke silently as its real caller arrived — see [conflict #33](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md) for the table.

`recordOffer` used the winner's candidate row as its idempotency guard; the engine writes that row first (it holds the score inputs), so the counter always returned early and `assignmentsOffered` stayed at zero while `assignmentsAcknowledged` climbed. Live verification caught it: `offered=0 acked=1` is not a state that can occur. After the fix, `offered=1 acked=1 acceptanceRate=1.00`.

**`recordReview` is the one method that has still never run.** Module 10 will be its first caller, and it carries the same shape of risk.

### Live verification

`test/manual/run-dispatch-curl.sh` — **19/19 against the local database**: booking queued, drained, assigned automatically, ack window opened, candidate scores persisted with the travel origin (`home_base`) and smoothed rating, acknowledged idempotently, and **no accept or decline route at any depth**.

Rule 1 was also confirmed working the hard way: a run reported `exhausted` because the test Pro genuinely had two overlapping committed bookings, and another reported `no_supply` because the Pro held a different service than the one booked. Both were the engine being right about bad test data.

## ERD cross-check

Every table these modules own was compared field-by-field against the
authoritative v10 ER diagram (Eraser, team TheUnknownGMR). The ERD — not the
narrative doc — is the source of truth for column names and types; the narrative
doc governs the business-rule _why_.

> ⚠️ **The Eraser MCP connector is not authorised in this workspace**, so the
> diagram cannot be pulled live. A verbatim copy was captured on 2026-08-10 at
> [`ERD_DATA_MODEL_V10.md`](ERD_DATA_MODEL_V10.md) and modules 1, 2, 3 and 6
> were reconciled against it. Re-paste it there if the diagram changes.

**Module 3 was reconciled against the ERD before its migration was written**, and seven proposed field names lost to it — `durationMinutes` not `expectedDurationMinutes`, `flatPrice` not `price`, `supports*` not `allows*`, `parentCategoryId` not `parentId`, `sortOrder` not `displayOrder`. Two proposed columns were dropped outright: `Service.allowsCash` (named by a ground rule but absent from the ERD) and `updatedByAdminId` on both catalog tables. See [conflicts #13, #14 and #15](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md).

**Deviation found and corrected:** `CustomerAddress.deliveryNotes` was added,
then removed (`20260807122120_remove_customer_address_delivery_notes`), because
the ERD's `CustomerAddress` carries `landmark` only. Net schema effect: none.
That is why module 2 is 8/9 rather than 9/9.

**Confirmed while cross-checking:**

- `Pro.cityId` and `Pro.monthlySalary` were already ERD-sanctioned columns; the 08-07 pass added only the missing endpoint.
- Location ingest uses the ERD's exact Redis key (`pros:live`), not an invented one.
- Admin-id columns on `ProApplication` are plain strings, not Prisma `@relation`s — matching the ERD's own drawing. Pre-existing, not changed.
- `pushToken` / `pushPlatform` exist on all three user tables and are written by nothing yet. Correct — they belong to module 12.
- `AdminAuditLog` was removed pending product decisions (`20260808230000_defer_admin_audit_log`).

## Verification

**Run 2026-08-10, after the module 4 build:**

| Check                     | Result                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npx jest` (unit)         | **24 suites / 212 tests passed** — was 16/85 before modules 3 and 4                                        |
| `npm run test:e2e`        | **6 suites / 125 tests passed** — was 3/13                                                                 |

| `npm run build`           | **Pass** (`nest build`)                                                                                    |
| `eslint --max-warnings=0` | **Pass** across `src`, `prisma` and `test`                                                                 |
| `prisma validate`         | **Pass**                                                                                                   |
| Migration ↔ schema parity | Hand-written SQL diffed against `prisma migrate diff` output — columns, index names and FK names all match |

Module 4 added 76 unit tests and 72 e2e assertions. The unit tests cover every rule in §4's table and **all 81 (from, to) pairs of the state machine**, legal and illegal. The e2e assertions are the Swagger contract: every booking route published as the envelope, bearer auth everywhere, the `409` documented on every route a state-machine rule can refuse, the `501` an online booking gets while Payments is unbuilt, `flatPrice` typed `string`, no contact detail anywhere in the chat schema, and **no route under `/pros/` matching `/cancel/i`** — principle 2 asserted as a test rather than a convention.

Module 3 contributed 51 unit tests and 40 e2e assertions before it, including 3 that compile the real `AppModule` to prove the Catalog ↔ Pros `forwardRef` resolves. That test now also covers module 4's wiring.

### Live verification against a real database — 2026-08-10

All 12 migrations were applied to a throwaway PostgreSQL 18 cluster (`initdb`, trust auth, port 55433), seeded, and driven end to end. **Neither the shared RDS instance nor the developer's own local cluster was touched** — the RDS credentials in `.env.local` no longer authenticate, and `DATABASE_URL` there is still blank.

| Check                           | Result                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `prisma migrate deploy`         | **12/12 applied**, including the three new ones                                          |
| `migrate diff` live DB ↔ schema | **"No difference detected"** — the hand-written SQL produces exactly what Prisma expects |
| `prisma db seed`                | 4 roles, admin, 2 cities, 5 categories, 3 services                                       |
| Schema shape                    | 22 tables; `bookings` at **42 columns**, matching the ERD; both `serviceId`s now `uuid`  |
| **Database guards**             | **18/18 rejected** — see below                                                           |
| **Cash lifecycle cURL suite**   | **24/24 passed** — `test/manual/run-booking-lifecycle-curl.sh`                           |

Every `CHECK` constraint was tested by trying to violate it. All 18 were refused: an active service with no commission rate, a percent rate above 100, an active service no flow can book, a self-parenting category, a service in a missing category, an invalid booking status, `paymentMode = 'crypto'`, **a cancellation attributed to a Pro**, a `started` booking with no `startedAt`, a `completed` one with no `completedAt`, a `cancelled` one with no `cancelledAt`, an invalid `bookingType`, a negative price, `frequency = 'hourly'`, `timeOfDay = '25:00'`, an end date before its start date, a chat message from ops, and a photo typed `selfie`.

Both migration guards were tested too. Against a table holding one booking, the `flatPrice` guard raised its exact message and refused. Against a pre-migration database holding `serviceId = 'plumbing-legacy-code'`, the FK guard raised and **left the column as `text`** — nothing half-migrated.

The lifecycle run produced this timeline, coordinates and all:

```
created → assigning → assigned → en_route → arrived → start_otp_failed → started → photo_proof_added → completed
```

with `flatPrice` frozen at `699.00`, `taxAmount` `106.63` (the component _within_ the price — [conflict #28](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md)), invoice `INV-2026-000006`, booking number `HB-2026-000004`, and 8 geo-stamped events.

### Two defects the live run exposed — both fixed

Neither was reachable by unit tests, because both hide behind mocks.

1. **All four advisory locks in `ProCountersService` used `$queryRaw` on a `void`-returning function**, which crashes Prisma. The identical bug was found and fixed in `pro-applications.service.ts` during the 08-08 pass — with an explanatory comment — but the counters service was never corrected, because **none of its four methods had a caller**. `recordCompletion` acquired one in this module and crashed on the first real call. `recordOffer`, `recordAcknowledgement` and `recordReview` would have done the same for modules 5 and 10.
2. **`recordCompletion` had become a silent no-op.** It still performed the completion itself — setting `status`/`completedAt` and writing the status event — from when module 4 did not exist. Its first line was `if (booking.status === 'completed') return;`, which is exactly the state its only caller now hands it, so **`completedJobs` never incremented**. It has been reduced to the counter it should be, made idempotent by a marker event, and the completion call site treats a counter failure as non-fatal — derived data is rebuilt nightly and source wins, so a finished job must not report failure because a statistic did not move.

Unit tests could not have caught either: they mock `$queryRaw` as a `jest.fn()` and assert on calls, not on Postgres's response.

**From the 2026-08-08 pass** (see [`reports/FINAL_VERIFICATION_REPORT_2026-08-08.md`](reports/FINAL_VERIFICATION_REPORT_2026-08-08.md)) — not re-run today:

| Check                                 | Result                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Full HTTP/cURL suite                  | 182/185 first run → **185/185** after a geocoder-dependency rerun |
| Prisma migrations on fresh PostgreSQL | 9/9 applied                                                       |
| Bootstrap seed                        | 4 system roles + super admin                                      |

That run deliberately used a mock OTP provider, a local Redis-compatible
process, deterministic local Nominatim responses, presigned-URL generation
without real uploads, and a local PostgreSQL 18 — not the managed production
equivalents. The 100% figure covers implemented routes in the local integration
scope; it is not a claim that unconfigured external systems are certified.

Reproduction: `test/manual/run-all-curl-tests.ps1` (honours `CURL_TEST_APP_LOG`).

20260810140000_add_booking_lifecycle        ← new, guard verified
```

`link_service_foreign_keys` is separate from the catalogue tables on purpose: it rewrites `pro_services.serviceId` and `bookings.serviceId` from `TEXT` to `UUID` and adds foreign keys, so it fails on any row whose `serviceId` is not a real `services.id`. **Seed the catalogue and remap any existing rows before running it.**

`add_booking_lifecycle` adds `bookings.flatPrice` as `NOT NULL`, because every booking has a price from the instant it exists and making the column nullable would permanently weaken the guarantee US-3.2 depends on. It therefore **refuses to run if any booking row already exists**, rather than inventing a price for rows that predate the column.

Both open with a `DO` block that counts the offending rows and raises a readable exception naming them, instead of letting a raw cast or constraint error surface.

## Recommendation

Phase 1 of the documented build order is complete bar Config, and phase 3's larger half is done: Identity, Customer Profile, Catalog, Pro Management and Booking are all built. Five of fifteen modules, and the ones every other module reads from.

**Modules 3 and 4 are verified against a real database.** All 12 migrations apply cleanly, the live schema matches Prisma exactly, all 18 database guards refuse what they should, and a cash job runs from creation to invoice — 24/24 in `test/manual/run-booking-lifecycle-curl.sh`. Two latent defects in module 6's counters were found and fixed in the process.

**Two environment problems are worth fixing before anyone else picks this up.** `.env.local`'s `DATABASE_URL` is blank, and because the config layering takes the _first_ file that defines a key, that blank value **shadows any fallback** rather than falling through — it is why nothing could connect. Separately, the RDS credentials in the `DB_*` vars no longer authenticate. Note the `DB_*` vars are TypeORM-era leftovers that nothing reads any more; only `DATABASE_URL` matters.

**Then module 5 (Dispatch).** It is now the single highest-value thing left: `DispatchPort` is defined and stubbed, so the work is implementing one interface rather than threading a new concern through the booking lifecycle. Until it lands, ops assigns every job by hand, and that is the difference between a working demo and a product.

**Module 7 (Payments) unblocks the other half of the funnel.** Online bookings currently fail at creation with a documented `501`; cash works end to end. `PaymentsPort` is the same shape of job.

Three decisions worth taking to product before they calcify:

1. **Catalog edits have no audit trail at all** — not even last-editor. That is a real ops risk on a table that holds prices and pay rates.
2. **Per-service cash eligibility does not exist**, despite a ground rule naming `Service.allowsCash`. If cash is meant to be restrictable per service, the ERD needs the column. Right now every service can be booked as cash, which is also the only mode that works.
3. **The flat price is treated as tax-inclusive** ([conflict #28](CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS.md)) — a ₹599 service invoices at ₹599 with ₹91.37 recorded as the GST component within it. Finance should confirm the catalogue prices were set on that basis; if they were meant to be pre-tax, every seeded price is wrong rather than the code.
