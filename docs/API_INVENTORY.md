# Homingo — API Inventory

**Date:** 12 August 2026
**Purpose:** one list of every API that exists, and every API still missing, so we do not build something twice.

Generated from the backend source, not from memory — every path below was read out of a controller file.

**Totals:** 231 endpoints built.

| Who calls it               | Built |
| -------------------------- | ----- |
| Customer app               | 33    |
| Pro app                    | 50    |
| Admin panel                | 133   |
| Auth (shared by all three) | 7     |
| Public, no login           | 6     |
| Razorpay webhooks          | 2     |

**Base URL:** every path is prefixed with `/api/v1`.

---

## How to read this

- **Section 1** — what already exists. Do not rebuild any of it.
- **Section 2** — what does not exist yet, and who it is for.
- **Section 3** — decisions we need from you.

The **Permission** column applies to admin endpoints only. It is the grant an admin's role must carry. Customer and Pro endpoints are scoped to the logged-in user instead — a customer can only ever read their own bookings.

# Section 2 — Not built yet

Four modules are missing entirely, plus two partial gaps. Feature lists below come from the project's own module document, not from us.

## 2.1 Safety & Support (Module 11) — nothing exists

Needed by **all three apps**.

**Customer app**

- Raise an SOS (one tap, sends live location + booking context)
- Raise a support ticket
- See my tickets and reply on the thread

**Pro app**

- Raise an SOS
- Raise a support ticket
- See my tickets and reply

**Admin panel**

- SOS alert queue — these must skip the normal ticket queue
- Acknowledge an SOS, then resolve or mark false alarm
- Ticket list with filters (billing, quality, dispute, app issue, no-start)
- Reply on a ticket, plus internal notes the raiser cannot see
- Set priority, escalate, assign to a support admin
- Close with a resolution note

**Also in this module:** automatic no-start detection — when a Pro marks arrival but never starts within the grace window, a ticket is raised for ops by itself. The Pro is never told.

## 2.2 Notifications (Module 12) — nothing exists

No app-facing endpoints. It is a service other modules call.

- Push via FCM (Android) and APNs (iOS)
- WhatsApp for OTP and transactional messages, SMS as fallback
- Templates with per-template channel routing
- Delivery status tracking
- Per-booking notification history, for support

**What this blocks today:** a Pro is assigned a booking and **is never told**. The system records when it should have notified them, but nothing sends. Right now a Pro has to open the app and look.

## 2.3 Config (Module 14) — model exists, no API

The `platform_settings` table holds ~20 numbers that control system behaviour, and each one can differ per city. **There is no way to read or change any of them except by editing the database directly.**

Needed:

- Admin: list settings for a city
- Admin: change one setting for a city
- Admin: reset a setting to its default

**What this blocks today — the important one:** `geo.enforceAreaServiceAvailability` ships **off**. The whole service-area system records which area a booking falls in, and logs that a booking _should_ have been refused, **but never actually refuses it**. Turning that gate on requires this API.

Other settings behind the same gap: dispatch pool size, acknowledgement window, travel-time target, cancellation fee, tax percent, commission auto-approve window.

**Also in Module 14:** `UiConfig` — server-driven home screen for the customer app, so the app's layout can change without an app-store release. Not built, and a bigger piece than settings.

## 2.4 Admin Console & Reporting (Module 15) — partially covered

Some of this module's features were built inside other modules. What is genuinely missing:

- **Report exports** — CSV / XLSX / PDF, generated async, filterable by Pro, city, service, date range. Report types: commission, operational, retention, city performance
- **Bulk operations surface** — mass edits that run async with a downloadable error log, so ops is never doing one-by-one changes
- **Audit log** — every mutating admin action with before/after state and IP. The document is explicit that this must include every availability toggle, so "why did this Pro get no jobs on Tuesday" stays answerable
- **Analytics** — bookings, revenue and retention, structured for marketing

## 2.5 Two smaller gaps

**Service → Pro assignment (admin).** Today a Pro is assigned to services from the Pro's own screen. There is no way to open a service and add Pros to it. When a new service launches, an admin must open every Pro one at a time. The reverse direction already exists for areas (`POST /admin/areas/by-service/:serviceId`), so this would follow the same shape.

**Live dispatch map (admin).** Module 15 lists a live map of bookings and Pros. Live positions are already written and read; there is no endpoint that returns them for a map view.

# Section 3 — Decisions we need

**1. Which of the four missing modules comes next?**
Our suggested order, and why:

| Order | Module                    | Why                                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | **Config (14)**           | Smallest, and it unblocks the service-area gate that is already built but switched off |
| 2     | **Notifications (12)**    | Pros are not being told about their assignments at all                                 |
| 3     | **Safety & Support (11)** | Needed before launch — SOS and disputes                                                |
| 4     | **Admin Console (15)**    | Reports and audit; useful, not blocking                                                |

**2. Who builds Config?**
It is a backend module, so it belongs with the backend developer. We are asking rather than starting, because a review module we built ourselves last week had to be deleted when the proper Module 10 landed and declared the same route. We would rather not repeat that.

**3. Customer app — which catalogue endpoint is it calling?**
There are two:

- `GET /geo/catalog?lat=&lng=` — area-aware. Marks each service available or not for that pin.
- `GET /catalog/services` — the plain list. **No location awareness at all.**

If the app is calling the second one, the entire service-area feature is invisible to customers. Worth confirming with the app team.

**4. Should unavailable services be hidden or shown greyed out?**
Currently they are **returned and flagged**, not hidden — the reasoning being that a thinly-mapped new area would otherwise look like an empty product. Confirm this is what you want.

---

## One thing that is built but switched off

The service-area system is complete: areas can be drawn on a map, named from Google, given their own service lists, and staffed with Pros. Bookings already record which area they fall into.

It just does not **stop** anything yet, because the switch that makes it enforce lives behind the missing Config API. That is one small API away from being live.
