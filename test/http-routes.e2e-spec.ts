/**

 * graph and stops there — no HTTP adapter, no route registration. That is the
 * right shape for what it tests, and it means it is **blind to route
 * collisions**: two controllers declaring the same path compile perfectly and
 * then crash the process at boot with `FST_ERR_DUPLICATED_ROUTE`.
 *
 * That is exactly what happened. `GET pros/me/payouts` was declared by both
 * module 6 and module 8, every unit and e2e suite stayed green, and the
 * application could not start (CONFLICTS_AND_DECISIONS #56).
 *
 * `init()` is what registers routes with Fastify and what runs every
 * `onModuleInit`, so this suite fails the moment two routes clash — without
 * needing a database, a port, or a single request.
