 * `processing`; only the webhook — or a deliberate reconciliation read — moves
 * it to `paid`, and the commission rows inside it are marked paid at that same
 * moment. US-8.11 is explicit, and the failure it prevents is the worst one in
 * the module: a Pro recorded as paid, with nothing in their account, and no row
 * anywhere that disagrees.
