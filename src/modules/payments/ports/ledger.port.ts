 * Stand-in until module 9 lands.

 * It fails **quietly**, and that is the opposite of what module 4's payments
 * stub does — deliberately. `createOrder` throwing a 501 was right because a
 * booking with a phantom order is unrecoverable. Here, the money has already
 * moved: the customer has been charged or the Pro is holding banknotes. A
 * missing ledger row does not make any of that wrong, and refusing to record a
 * cash collection because module 9 is absent would strand a Pro at a
 * customer's door with cash the platform will not acknowledge.
 *
 * What is lost is the audit trail, and it is recoverable — every entry below
 * can be rebuilt from `Order`, `Booking` and `CashHandover`, which is exactly
 * what module 9's reconciliation is for.
