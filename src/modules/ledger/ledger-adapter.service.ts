/**
 * The eight events that move money, expressed as account pairs.
 *
 * This class is the whole of module 9's "business logic", and it is a
 * translation table rather than a decision-maker: modules 7 and 8 already
 * decided what happened, and every method here says only which two accounts it
 * happened between.
 *
 * ## The accounts, and how they net to zero
 *
 * | Event              | Debit                    | Credit                   |
 * | ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
 * | Online capture     | `gateway:razorpay`       | `revenue:bookings`       |
 * | Cash collected     | `cash_in_hand:<pro>`     | `revenue:bookings`       |
 * | Handover confirmed | `bank:platform`          | `cash_in_hand:<pro>`     |
 * | Refund settled     | `revenue:bookings`       | `gateway:razorpay`       |
 * | Commission accrued | `expense:pro_commission` | `payable:pro:<pro>`      |
 * | Incentive credited | `expense:incentives`     | `payable:pro:<pro>`      |
 * | Reversal (unpaid)  | `payable:pro:<pro>`      | `expense:pro_commission` |
 * | Deduction recovered| `payable:pro:<pro>`      | `revenue:recoveries`     |
 * | Payout confirmed   | `payable:pro:<pro>`      | `bank:platform`          |
 *
 * `cash_in_hand:<pro>` goes up when a Pro takes banknotes and back to zero when
 * they hand them over — so it is the account `Pro.cashInHand` is a cache of,
 * which makes "do the two agree" a real reconciliation check.
 *
 * `payable:pro:<pro>` goes up as work is done and back to zero at settlement:
 * accruals and incentives credit it by the gross, and settlement debits it by
 * the net plus every deduction recovered. If it does not return to zero after a
 * paid payout, something is missing — which is the third ledger-scope check.
 *
 * ## Every method here is non-fatal at its call site
 *
 * By the time any of these runs the money has already moved. A missing entry is
 * recoverable — the entire ledger is rebuildable from `Order`, `Booking`,
 * `CashHandover`, `BookingCommission` and `CommissionPayout`, which is exactly
 * what reconciliation checks — whereas refusing a cash collection because a
 * bookkeeping row failed would strand a Pro at a customer's door.
